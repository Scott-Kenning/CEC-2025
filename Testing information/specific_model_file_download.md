# Model File Download Criterion:

If your code requires specific files for model data (e.g., model weights stored in HDF5, Pickle, JSON format, etc.), please specify these dependencies in the README file.

Uploading large files directly to GitHub may cause delays. If this is the case, you can use a public OneDrive, Google Drive link, or another service to provide access. Teams will face penalties if files are not uploaded on time (file modification dates will be checked for OneDrive and Google Drive). 

Alternative download methods are allowed, as long as the files are uploaded within the challengeâ€™s time constraints and the upload time is visible.
