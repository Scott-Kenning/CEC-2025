# Setting Up `CEC_2025_dataset` Environment Variable

This guide explains how to set up an environment variable named `CEC_2025_dataset` to point to the folder containing `CEC_2025`, so that you can use it in your Python code without hardcoding the full path.

---

## 1. **Windows Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set the Environment Variable**

1. Open **Start** and search for **"Environment Variables"**.
2. Click on **Edit the system environment variables**.
3. In the **System Properties** window, click on **Environment Variables...** at the bottom.
4. Under **User variables**, click **New...** to create a new environment variable.
5. In the **Variable name** field, enter `CEC_2025_dataset`.
6. In the **Variable value** field, enter the full path to the folder containing `CEC_2025` (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\CEC_2025`).
7. Click **OK** to save the variable.
8. Click **OK** again to close the **Environment Variables** window.

### **Step 2: Testing the Environment Variable in Python (not required)**

Well the environment variable should now work, it'd help to test it. Below is some Python code which you can use to reference the `CEC_2025_dataset` folder:

```python
import os

# Get the path to the folder from the environment variable
dataset_folder = os.getenv('CEC_2025_dataset')

if dataset_folder:
    # Print or list files in the folder
    print(f"Dataset folder is located at: {dataset_folder}")
else:
    print("Please set the 'CEC_2025_dataset' environment variable.")
```

## 2. **macOS Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set the Environment Variable**

1. Open Terminal
2. Type the following command to open your `.bash_profile` (if using Bash) or `.zshrc ` (if using Zsh):
```
nano ~/.bash_profile  # For Bash users
```
Or if you are using Zsh:
```
nano ~/.zshrc  # For Zsh users
```
3. Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing the path with the actual location of your `CEC_2025` folder:
*Note: You will need to go down to the end of your file, make sure to change the file path to the correct one on your machine.
```
export CEC_2025_dataset="/Users/YourUsername/Documents/CEC_2025"
```
4. Save and exit the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then press Y to confirm, and hit Enter.

```
source ~/.bash_profile  # For Bash users
```
Or if you are using Zsh:
```
source ~/.zshrc  # For Zsh users
```
5. Test the Variable
You can test the variable by trying the following commad:
```
echo $CEC_2025_dataset
```
Which should output something like this:
```
C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\CEC_2025
```

### **Step 2: Testing the Environment Variable in Python (not required)**
In your Python script, you can access the environment variable like this:

```python
import os

# Get the path to the folder from the environment variable
dataset_folder = os.getenv('CEC_2025_dataset')

if dataset_folder:
    # Print or list files in the folder
    print(f"Dataset folder is located at: {dataset_folder}")
else:
    print("Please set the 'CEC_2025_dataset' environment variable.")

```
# Special Note

Some IDE configurations (like PyCharm, or Jupyter) require additional setup for environment variables because they donâ€™t automatically inherit environment variables from the system shell. You may need to do some eztra mapping for those IDE's.
