# Introduction
Welcome to the CEC 2025 Programming Competition! Everything you need is in this GitHub, and we recommend the following steps to get started:

1. Read the rest of this README.md
2. Read the tutorial linked in `githubHowToUseGithubDesktop.txt`
3. Read the tutorial linked in `githubHowToFork.txt`
4. Fork this repo
5. Clone your forked repo locally on your machine
6. Start coding!

# Getting Help
Please follow the steps below if you need help:

1. Check the included documentation for logistics and scoring questions
2. Check the Programming Competition Case for competition questions
3. Check the Discord for previously answered questions
4. If you have done all of that, ask the Directors for help. If we can answer your question, it will be posted on the Discord in English and French.

# Important Notes
In your README.md please specify:

- How to run your code
- What language and version your code uses (e.g., Python 3.11)
- A list of required packages (e.g., Pandas, NumPy), with versions if needed (e.g., pytorch==2.1.116). A `requirements.txt` would also suffice.
- If needed, what OS your code should be run on. Any specifications of this sort not included in your README cannot be assumed to be on the Directorsâ€™ machine(s).

# Info Files
The following files provide all the information regarding the competition. This includes:
- The Case Document
- Presentation
- Example Output
- Testing information
- GitHub Info

# Accessing Dataset
We have given you access to the images through the OneDrive link here:

https://dalu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/or942416_dal_ca/EdKN7DMS8tNHm-dPmV56JCEB46o-vSoG4WMfbcdNRZCX8Q?e=PboqSt

You'll notice that the dataset is to be saved as a 7z file. You will need to install either 7-zip, Keka, or p7zip to extract the dataset.

7-zip can be downloaded for Windows using the following link:
https://www.7-zip.org

Keka can be downloaded for MacOS using the following link:
https://www.keka.io/en/

On Ubuntu, please install p7zip (or any other 7z supported software) by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install p7zip-full
```


When extracting the file, make sure to use 7-zip or Keka.

The password for the 7z file is:

```
gT5&dK9zR2wQ!aP0eY3B#6vL1zXhF8j
```

# Testing
Your code will be tested by comparing the results of your algorithm to the correct results, with each team getting a percentage value for how accurate there code was. A folder labeled 'CEC_test' will have a set amount of test images (that only the directors have access to) corresponding to 'yes' or 'no'. The file format for these images will be PNG, with the names of each image being 'test_xxx.png'. Note: "x" in this case represents the number of files tested, similar to the yes and no directories. Make sure you have a testing script referencing this folder located at `/CEC_2025/CEC_test`. This can be done very simply by employing environment variables that you can expect the Directors will have on their machines. See `/Testing Information/Setting Up Environment Variables.md` for more info.  

Results will be compared with the correct results in Excel. It is necessary that competitors output their results to a CSV, XLSX, or Google Sheet file (or similar). While other UIs are encouraged for aesthetic purposes, a .csv file or anything similar for outputting raw results is necessary for testing purposes! You can see the sample output in the info folder for more details relating to this!

Teams who are abke to construct an algorythm with >=95% accuracy will receive bonus points, while those unable to meet benchmark threshold with >=65% accuracy will be subject to point deductions.

As long as your code outputs the test image being tested (1st column) and the result, which is either 'yes' or 'no' (2nd column), your code will be ready for testing.

# Potentially Useful Info:

## Retrieve Dataset
Below is an example code which accesseses this folder and then runs through using the root directory. 

Note: This code was written for MacOS interfacing.
Note: This references the environment variable CEC_2025_dataset which we encourage you to setup on your local computers. In this repository check `Testing Information\Setting Up Environment Variables.md` for more information

```ruby
import os
from os import path

dataset_dir = os.getenv('CEC_2025_dataset')  # Retrieves the path from the environment variable

# Initialize lists to hold data
image_paths = []
targets = []

total_images = 0

# Map for target labels
label_map = {'no': 0, 'yes': 1, 'CEC_test': 2} 

# Loop through subdirectories in the dataset directory
for subdir in os.listdir(dataset_dir):
    subdir_path = path.join(dataset_dir, subdir)

    if os.path.isdir(subdir_path):
        subdir_path_list = os.listdir(subdir_path)
        for image in subdir_path_list:
            image_paths.append(path.join(subdir_path, image))
            targets.append(label_map[subdir])

        total_images += len(subdir_path_list)
        print(f"Number of images in '{subdir}' directory: {len(subdir_path_list)}")

print(f'Total number of images: {total_images}')
```
This should ouput something like this:
```
Number of images in 'no' directory: 8727
Number of images in 'CEC_test' directory: 1
Number of images in 'yes' directory: 9310
Total number of images: 18038
```
## Checking File Paths
You may also want to check the file paths of your images:
```ruby
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'image_path': image_paths,
    'target': targets
}, index=np.arange(0, total_images))

print(df.head())
```
Which should output something like this:
```
                                          image_path  target
0  /Users/orionwiersma/Documents/CEC_2025/no/no_...       0
1  /Users/orionwiersma/Documents/CEC_2025/no/no_...       0
2  /Users/orionwiersma/Documents/CEC_2025/no/no_...       0
3  /Users/orionwiersma/Documents/CEC_2025/no/no_...       0
4  /Users/orionwiersma/Documents/CEC_2025/no/no_...       0
```
